ObjLibrary Development Log
==========================



2012 Jan 27 (1:00)
------------------

Released to CS409



2012 Jan 27 (4:30)
------------------

1. draw() no longer crashes when a material refernces an image that cannot be loaded.
2. Added support for Tf command in MTL files
3. Added warning for entirely-transparent material

Released to CS809



2012 Jan 30
-----------

1. Images now load correctly when a bad image is specified first



2012 Feb 1
----------

1. Added SpriteFont.h/.cpp



2012 Feb 3
----------

1. Fixed Vector.cpp constructor



2012 Feb 7
----------

1. Added function to draw an ObjModel with the materials in an MTL library with a specific filename.



2012 Feb 14
-----------

1. Decreased the percision of the isNormal()/isUnit() function in Vector3.  A Vector3 normalized with the normalize() (or getNormalized() ) function should now count as normalized.
2. Fixed getDisplayList() in the ObjModel class to not include loading the texture in the display list it returns.  This makes drawing the model 5ish times faster.
3. Added function to draw an ObjModel without activating its materials.



2012 Feb 27
-----------

1. Added "#include <string>" to TextureManager.h.
2. draw in SpriteFont no long sets shading mode to GL_FLAT.



2012 Feb 28
-----------

1. Added "#include <cstdlib>" to MtlLibrary.h.
2. Added "#include <cstring>" to TextureManager.h.



2012 March 15
-------------

1. Fixed constructors in Vector.cpp to accept 0 length without crashing.



2012 March 24
-------------

1. Reversed internal ordering in BoundedGrid to match C++.
2. Added Bounded3DGrid



2012 March 30
-------------

1. Reversed rotation on rotateAroundY to match rotateAroundX and rotateAroundZ.



2012 April 25
-------------

1. Fiddled with sort() in BoundedArray.
2. Added explicit typecasts to file reading in Functions.cpp.
3. Added default bump multiplier to MtlLibrary.cpp.
4. Changed internal constants to unsigned int in ObjModel.
5. Removed unreachable invariant test from TextureBmp.cpp.
6. Added explicit typecast to Vector.cpp.


2012 May 3
----------

1. Added setSize()/setLength() with fill value to BoundedArray.
